## Purpose of this repository:
  
A template to create simple to use GitHub actions on any repo for initial setup.

## Example action to run a `python.py` file to verify no errors in code:

If errors in code exist they will be listed in the actions console. Also
you can run more than one file, seperated with commas.
   
## Up to you to decide on your triggers, I used `push` and `pull_request`

a good one to use also is `workflow_dispacth` to manually run the action.
 
```yaml
name: Run Python file
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
```         
  
## Install required `dependencies.`

This way your can run, Python file.

```yaml  
jobs:
  build-and-analyze:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Python Action
      uses: jge162/Action-workflows@v1.0.1

    - run: |
        echo "Install required dependencies" 
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install python3
```         
    
## Lastly use a for loop to run multipe instances.

This way you can run one or multple python scripts.

```yaml
     - run: |
        echo "Run, Build Application using scripts"
        python3 -c "
        scripts = ['./script.py', './script2.py'] 
        for script in scripts:
            with open(script, 'r') as file:
                exec(file.read())
        "
```
