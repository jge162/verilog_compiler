## Purpose of Verilog Compiler:
  
To be able to quickly load your .v files to GitHub and run and test them. It will notify you
of errors in your code just like a compiler should. It requires to files to run. First you
need to create a directoy script/sh to run a script. Then you chose which .v files you want to run.

## veriflog_compiler.v 

```yaml
name: Verilog Build and Analysis

on:
  schedule:
  - cron: '0 0,12 * * *' 
    # action will run everyday at 12 am and 12 pm
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build-and-analyze:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Verilog Compiler
      uses: jge162/verilog_compiler@1.0.0

    - run: |
        echo "Install required dependencies"
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install iverilog
        sudo apt-get install verilator

    - run: |
        echo "Set executable permission on script file"
        chmod +x script/sh
        chmod +x ./verilog_test_case.v
        
    - run: |
        echo "Run, Build Application using script"
        ./script/sh
```

## Script file you need to run your .v files:

```yaml
#!/bin/bash

# Define the name of the project
PROJECT_NAME="verilog_test_case"

# Define the list of Verilog files to be included in the project
VERILOG_FILES="verilog_test_case.v"

# Compile the Verilog files into an executable
iverilog -o $PROJECT_NAME $VERILOG_FILES

# Run the simulation for scripts
vvp $PROJECT_NAME

# Print a message indicating that the script has finished running
echo "Success! Script has finished running."
```
